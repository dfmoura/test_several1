What is cloud computing?

  Backing up files that are stored on desktop and mobile devices to prevent data loss
  Deploying applications connected to on-premises infrastructure
  Running code without needing to manage or provision servers
x On-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

Correct
The correct response option is On-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
The other response options are incorrect because:
    It is possible to back up files to the cloud, but this response option does not describe cloud computing as a whole.
    Deploying applications connected to on-premises infrastructure is a sample use case for a hybrid cloud deployment. Remember that cloud computing also has cloud and on-premises (or private cloud) deployment models.
    AWS Lambda is an AWS service that lets you run code without needing to manage or provision servers. This description does not describe cloud computing as a whole. AWS Lambda is explained in greater detail later in the course.

What is another name for on-premises deployment?

x Private cloud deployment
  Cloud-based application
  Hybrid deployment
  AWS Cloud


  The correct response option is Private cloud deployment.

The other response options are incorrect because:
    Cloud-based applications are fully deployed in the cloud and do not have any parts that run on premises.
    A hybrid deployment connects infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not in the cloud, such as on-premises resources. However, a hybrid deployment is not equivalent to an on-premises deployment because it involves resources that are located in the cloud.
    The AWS Cloud offers three cloud deployment models: cloud, hybrid, and on-premises. This response option is incorrect because the AWS Cloud is not equivalent to only an on-premises deployment.

How does the scale of cloud computing help you to save costs?

  You do not have to invest in technology resources before using them.
x The aggregated cloud usage from a large number of customers results in lower pay-as-you-go prices.
  Accessing services on-demand helps to prevent excess or limited capacity.
  You can quickly deploy applications to customers and provide them with low latency.	

The correct response option is The aggregated cloud usage from a large number of customers results in lower pay-as-you-go prices.

This answer describes how customers can benefit from massive economies of scale in cloud computing.

The other response options are incorrect because:
    Not having to invest in technology resources before using them relates to Trade upfront expense for variable expense.
    Accessing services on-demand to prevent excess or limited capacity relates to Stop guessing capacity.
    Quickly deploying applications to customers and providing them with low latency relates to Go global in minutes.

Which Amazon EC2 instance type is suitable for data warehousing applications?

  Memory optimized
x Storage optimized
  General purpose
  Compute optimized

Data warehousing typically requires large amounts of storage and high I/O performance to efficiently handle large datasets and query processing. Storage optimized instances are designed to provide high disk throughput, making them ideal for use cases like data warehousing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

Which Amazon EC2 instance type balances compute, memory, and networking resources?

  Memory optimized
  Storage optimized
x General purpose
  Compute optimized

General purpose instances are designed to provide a balanced mix of compute, memory, and networking resources, making them suitable for a wide variety of workloads. They are ideal for applications that do not have specific resource bottlenecks in any one area, such as web servers, development environments, and small databases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

Which Amazon EC2 instance type is ideal for high-performance databases?

x Memory optimized
 Storage optimized
 General purpose
 Compute optimized

Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast access to large amounts of memory, which is crucial for high-performance databases that need to store and retrieve large datasets quickly, such as in-memory databases (e.g., Redis, SAP HANA) and real-time data processing applications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

Which Amazon EC2 instance type offers high-performance processors?

   Memory optimized
   Storage optimized
   General purpose
 x Compute optimized

Compute optimized instances are specifically designed for workloads that require a high level of CPU performance, such as high-performance computing (HPC), batch processing, machine learning inference, and scientific modeling.
