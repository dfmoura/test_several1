Setting up OpenVPN on Linux using the terminal involves a few steps. Below is a general guide assuming you have the OpenVPN client installed on your Linux machine.

1. **Install OpenVPN:**
   Make sure you have OpenVPN installed on your system. You can install it using the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can use:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install openvpn
   ```

   On Red Hat-based systems:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install openvpn
   ```

2. **Copy Configuration File:**
   Copy your `vpn-ubertubos.ovpn` file to the OpenVPN configuration directory. This directory is usually `/etc/openvpn/`. Use the following command to copy the file:

   ```bash
   sudo cp vpn-ubertubos.ovpn /etc/openvpn/
   ```

3. **Start OpenVPN:**
   Navigate to the OpenVPN configuration directory:

   ```bash
   cd /etc/openvpn
   ```

   Start OpenVPN using the configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo openvpn vpn-ubertubos.ovpn
   ```

   You might need to enter your sudo password.

4. **Authenticate:**
   OpenVPN may prompt you for your username and password. Enter the credentials provided by your VPN service.

5. **Verify Connection:**
   Once connected, you should see log messages indicating a successful connection. You can also check your public IP address to confirm that your traffic is going through the VPN.

6. **Stop OpenVPN:**
   To disconnect, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where OpenVPN is running.

Keep in mind that the exact steps might vary depending on your Linux distribution and the specific details of your OpenVPN configuration file. Make sure to replace `vpn-ubertubos.ovpn` with the actual filename if it's different.

Additionally, the configuration file may have specific requirements or dependencies. If there are additional certificates or keys required, make sure they are also present in the same directory as your `.ovpn` file.

Always refer to the documentation provided by your VPN service for any specific instructions related to their setup.
